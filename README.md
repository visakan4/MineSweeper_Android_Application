# Minesweeper

## Project Summary

Minesweeper is a 2-dimensional grid based game. It is usually played in Windows desktops. Here, I have implemented a android version of the Minesweeper game. The UI of this game is based on football theme. UI of the applicaiton is developed based on Nielsons Usability heuristics.

  * Whistle - It is displayed to represent that game is ready and will start once the user clicks on the grid.
  * Refree - It is displayed to represent that the game is ongoing.
  * Yellow card - It is displayed to represent that the game is currently paused.
  * Red card - It is displayed to represent that the game is lost.
  * Golden cup - It is displayed to represent that the game is won.
